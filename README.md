## Description
Google Colab–based workflow for training a YOLO object detection model for **drone vision**.  

This project is designed for my autonomous aerial vehicle design team so teammates can quickly:
- Generate a synthetic images for various objects.
- Train a YOLO model on generated images.
- Test the trained model directly in Colab (including webcam demos).
